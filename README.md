## Introduction
The seismic wavelet is the combination of the wavelet transmitted into the earth, modified by the earthâ€™s transmission, and then by the instruments responses. Then, the wavelet processing describes what is done to alter the wavelet so that it is short, well-behaved, and more useful for interpretation.
I will introduce some basics on seismic wavelet processing showing Python codes examples using the seismic sweep from a Land vibrator.

## Vibrator Sweep
An encoded swept-frequency signal (called pilot sweep) transmitted from the vibrator control unit (VCU) in the recording truck to similar units in each vibrator truck.
