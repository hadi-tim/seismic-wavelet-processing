## Introduction
The seismic wavelet is the combination of the wavelet transmitted into the earth, modified by the earthâ€™s transmission, and then by the instruments responses. Then, the wavelet processing describes what is done to alter the wavelet so that it is short, well-behaved, and more useful for interpretation.
I will introduce some basics on seismic wavelet processing showing Python codes examples using the seismic sweep from a Land vibrator.

## Vibrator Sweep
An encoded swept-frequency signal (called pilot sweep) transmitted from the vibrator control unit (VCU) in the recording truck to similar units in each vibrator truck.
For the following steps I used a time series sweep in '.csv' format can be found in ./data folder.

The sweep parameters are the following:
- sweep length: 14 seconds
- start frequency: 6 Hz
- end frequency: 95 Hz

Function below simply plot the sweep using Matplotlib Python library.
```Python
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

def plot_sweep(file):
    plt.style.use('seaborn-poster')
    %matplotlib inline
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    plt.figure(figsize = (16, 4))
    plt.plot(df['TIME'], df['AMPLITUDE'])
    plt.xlabel('time(ms)')
    plt.ylabel('amplitude')
    plt.show()
plot_sweep('sweep.csv')
```
